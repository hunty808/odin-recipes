    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of the <em>best</em> for hamburgers ever created. <strong>Follow</strong> the ingredients listed below and all instructions!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Hamburger Bun</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the beef. Sprinkle evenly with the Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until they are just combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the meat mixture into fourths. Take 1/4 of the meat mixture and use your hands to press it into the shape of a hamburger patty that is about 3/4 inch thick. Make an indention in the middle of the patty to prevent bulging in the center of the hamburger as it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, making 4 hamburgers.</li>
            <li>Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 4-5 minutes on the first side. Flip the burgers over and cook an additional 4-5 minutes, until the burgers have reached the desired doneness.*</li>
            <li>If adding cheese, lay a slice of cheese on each burger patty about 1 minute before taking the burgers off the grill, so the cheese has a chance to melt.</li>
            <li>Serve the burgers on hamburger buns with optional hamburger toppings.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>I usally cook for 4 minutes on each side for medium-well burgers</p>
