    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Heres a great recipes for making really good bacon from <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-perfect-bacon-in-the-oven-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-107970"><em>Kitchn</em></a>. They provide a detailed recipe and clear to follow steps along with the ingredients needed.</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces sliced bacon</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400°F and prepare the baking sheet. Arrange rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil, making sure there is overhang on all 4 sides (overlap a few sheets if needed, this makes cleanup easier).</li>
            <li>Arrange the bacon on the baking sheet. Arrange 12 ounces bacon on the baking sheet in a single layer. The slices can be close together or touching, but don't let them overlap or they'll stick together during cooking.</li>
            <li>Bake the bacon. Bake until the bacon is deep golden-brown and crispy, about 14 minutes for regular bacon and 18 minutes for thick-cut bacon. Exact baking time will depend on the thickness of the bacon and how crispy you like it. Begin checking the bacon after 12 minutes. The bacon fat will sputter and bubble as the bacon cooks, but shouldn't splatter the way it does on the stovetop.</li>
            <li>Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Use tongs to transfer the bacon to the paper towels to drain and finish crisping. Serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Clean up. If you want to save the bacon grease, let it cool slightly, then pour it through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof container and refrigerate. If you don't want to save the grease, let it solidify on the baking sheet, then crumple the foil or paper around it and discard.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Even crispier bacon:</strong>For even crispier bacon, fit a metal rack over the lined baking sheet and place the bacon on the rack before baking, which allows the bacon allows to cook from all sides and become extra-crispy.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage:</strong>Refrigerate leftover bacon for 1 week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Rewarm the bacon in the microwave or oven before serving.</p>
